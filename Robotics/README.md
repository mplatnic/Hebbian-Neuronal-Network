RoboCupJunior OnStage (formerly Dance) invites teams to develop a creative stage performance using autonomous robots that they have designed, built and programmed. The objective is to create a robotic performance of 1 to 2 minutes that uses technology to engage an audience. The challenge is intended to be open-ended. This includes a whole range of possible performances, for example dance, storytelling, theatre or an art installation. The performance may involve music but this is optional. Teams are encouraged to be as creative, innovative and entertaining, in both the design of the robots and in the design of the overall performance. The performance may involve up to two team members on the stage at any one time but this is optional.  The emphasis must be on the robotic performance rather than the human performers. </br>

Teams will be considered Preliminary unless they have one or more members who have attended two international RoboCupJunior competitions in any league. All team members must be aged 13 to 19-year-old(age as of 1st of July). </br>

Teams are judged in the following areas: technical demonstration, technical interview, OnStage performance and a Technical Description Paper. </br></br>

Example:
- Robots may be of any size. Participants should design their robot(s) in sizes which they can carry by themselves. A team may have and use any number of robots. However, using multiple robots does not necessarily result in obtaining higher points. Large robots do not count for more. It is advised to high light interactive systems between robots.
- Teams are encouraged to design their robot(s) with a communication function. Robots are encouraged to communicate with each other on stage,for example, with a Bluetooth communication option (refer to 2.7 and 2.8). There must be no communication between off-stage and on-stage devices.
- The only allowed communication protocols are infrared (IR), Bluetooth (LE and classic) and ZigBee
- The OnStage Performance is an opportunity to demonstrate the technical aspects of the robot(s), design and construction through a stage show. This could be, for example, a magic show, theatre performance, storytelling, comedy show, dance or art installation. Teams are encouraged to be creative, innovative and take risks in their use of technology and materials when creating their performances. Refer to the OnStage Performance Score Sheet for more details (40% of score)
- The duration of the performance routine must be no less than 1 minute and no more than 2 minutes.
- Each team will have a total of 5 minutes for their performance. 
- Teams may use music to complement their performance. Teams may find it useful to include a “beep”at the beginning of their music as a start signal.
- The size of the performance stage area will be marked in a rectangular area of 4 x 3 meters (m) for robots with the 4m side facing the judges. This rectangular area is withina stage with a minimum size of 5 x 4 meters.
- The boundary of the performance stage area will be marked with a 50 millimeter (mm) black tape-line. Teams are allowed to use the black boundary to identify the performance stage area. The floor provided shallbe made of flat (non-glossy) white painted MDF (compressed wood fiber).
- Static props which do not form an integral part of the performance are discouraged since the focus of the performance should be on robots. The kind of props that are considered "interactive" are:•Props interact with robots via sensors•Props interact with robots via communication (refer to 1.4).
- Human-robot interaction is encouraged; humans cannot physically touch the robot, just interact with the robot's sensors. Interaction which is used to alter the robot's behavior directly, e.g. to keep it inside the black lines, will be rewarded far less in comparison to more intelligent interaction (e.g. a robot following human using a camera).
- Interaction between robots is highly encouraged. Robots are allowed to physically touch one another and can interact through sensors and wired/wireless communication
