Climate Change 101: A brief overview of climate change science.

Teaching Climate Change: Best Practices: A collection of resources with basic information on climate literacy and tools for overcoming misconceptions in the classroom.

The Climate Literacy & Energy Awareness Network (CLEAN): A catalog of existing online resources that have been reviewed for scientific accuracy and pedagogical potential. The catalog can be searched by grade level, resource type and other criteria. Included are learning activities, videos, visualizations, and tips for teaching. 

The U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy: An “education toolbox” that teachers can search for lesson plans, videos, and other resources by topic and grade level.

NASA Wavelength: A digital collection of reviewed resources for Earth and space science educators. Searches can be filtered by topic, grade level, and strategy. Resources include videos, activities, informative text, models, and demonstrations.

Climate.gov: A multi-purpose resource from the U.S. government on climate change. It includes educational activities, a library of presentations that can be downloaded, and access to climate data and services.

U.S. Global Change Research Program: A compilation of climate change resources such as the Climate Literacy Framework and climate change education videos from the National Park Service.

NASA's Global Climate Change Website: High-quality information about climate science from America’s space agency. Winner of the 2011 Webby Award for Best Science Site, it includes engaging interactive activities and a series of quizzes on a variety of climate-related topics.

The Teacher-Friendly Guide to Climate Change: From the Paleontological Research Institute.

Alliance for Climate Education: ACE's mission is “to educate young people on the science of climate change and empower them to take action.” New from ACE: Our Climate, Our Future.
